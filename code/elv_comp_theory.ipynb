One option would be to assume that for $T \\leq 25^\\circ$C (therefore including the high temperature used in the competition experiments), growth increases with temperature as a Boltzmann-Arrhenius function. From Reuman *et al.* (2014) we also expect $K_S$ to increase exponentially with temperature (although your $K_S$ often dip back down at the higher temperatures).
